# Data_Visualization
This is my second project on python from python crash course book. It is a project made by python librery called plotly which helps to visualize data that we get from diffrent resources.
This project uses github API to get java most sttared Repositories on github and plot the graph on web browser to show the the rate of star each Repository get.<br/>
It also contain diffrent codding exercises on ploting graphs using matplotlib and plotly libreries
